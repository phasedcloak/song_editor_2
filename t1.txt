I'm loving that your grace is changing me My perspective, how I see, how I feel I see the world, it's changing me To be one who takes an eternal perspective To be the one who values the long game To know in this life everything I face is momentary Compared to eternity I'm loving what your grace taught me It's changing everything about me Now I'm seeing more of who you are Oh, it's changing how I interact with you Before, I wanted nothing to do with you But now all I think about is you God changed me to love you more and more That you would be the one that I adore above us
Now, above all else In my time with you Speak to my heart
Oh God,
I never want to be apart
Speak to me, God May your life -giving words change every part
The way I think and the way I act,
God May I change when I see
As I see you,
God As I see you, God Thank you
Thank you
Thank you, God For being the same
Your grace overflowing on me
May I never hug But always give out the grace That you've shown me
Your grace has changed my life forever
I am so glad That we will always be together
There is no shortage
Of your grace
May others see your grace But what they see in me May you spill out Through every crack in me May your glory shine
Through everything you do
In my life, oh God May this dream and prayer Come true
Come true
Or be answered
By you
